# Web-Scraping-of-All-Housing-Listings-of-Different-Cities
A simple web scraping code for scraping all housing listings in a Netherlands housing website. I scraped all listing from different cities and from multiple pages in the website.
PS: this a project that I did for a web scraping assignment. Note that I have no previous knowledge or experience of python. Therefore, if you have any suggestion to improve the code feel free to contact me.
